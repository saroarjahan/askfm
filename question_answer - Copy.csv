Thoughts on people who constantly post about how they are single on Instagram=>People are different some have so much enthusiasm to become two but some don't.
I think it's always better to have your paper and pen than instagram to write about all these things or a page somewhere in those "apps nobody cares about" and write there

Sweetie what the heII are you doing out here!? Don't you know how dangerous it is for a little girl out alone in this timeline?
I havent seen her since we had that fight...She ran off..*frowns*=>We need to go find her hon, you know how dangerous this timeline is, HorrorTale isn't a place for kids to run off on their own *Horror then picks up Allura on his back and runs off to go find Plague*
*plague is home who knows where she went it's not a great idea for an eight year old to be all on her own rip*=>*You said she is home so she's at home lmao jk i know what you meant*
*Horror is going to go ballistic if anything happens to Plague*
I know it just hurt...My baby being mad at me.. *sighs*We're not bad parents right?=>No we aren't, we keep her out of trouble even if she doesn't like that we do, while we're on the subject..where is our little girl?

Be careful okay?I can't save you all the time.~=>Hon, I'm the one that saves you, usually, I'll be just fine *he then kisses her one more time before heading over to the heIIhound he really shouldn't be messing with lmao*
*plague sobs into her sweater*=>What's wrong sweetie? *Horror lifts her up and sets her on his knee*
*that makes her ignite into flames*....*growls at you oh no*=>*Horror then backs up aways and fires sharp bones at the heIIhound, he was Determined to have it as his next meal though a dog igniting into flames should be a red flag that says "is not a normal dog"*
*smacks you gently* I dont eat you know that hon but do whatever it takes to keep you and plague fed.=>*Horror smiled and kissed her on her forehead* Don't worry hon, you know I'd never let Plague go hungry
*probably a good thing Nova doesn't hear this, it would have gone over VERY poorly, remember what she did to Cross for having that viewpoint, but it'd be worse for Horror since she doesn't like him*=>*It would probably end like this*
Shut up.*kisses you setting you down*=>*Horror kisses her back lmao he probably píssed off Allura with his comment about males being stronger than females*
Make me~ Ally? How do you feel about having a dog stew for supper?
*fish spray water in your eyesocket blinding you temporarily so he can escape managing to jump off the counter dashing into the living room hiding under the couch*=>*Luckily for Fish, Horror was now distracted with the new heIIhound that had shown up which gives him the chance to make an escape but next time Horror sees him, he's going to make a Fish fillet for spraying water in his eye sockets*
*sniffs you*=>This makes up for the meal I just lost, come here! *He slams down his cleaver into the unsuspecting heIIhound*

¿Alguna vez has pasado la noche en blanco?=>"Un soñador" "Tú no lo sabías, pero yo suspiraba por ti. Cada día esperaba con ansias contenidas el verte de nuevo, mirándome con esos ojitos que me volvían loco, tú me mirabas y sé que esos ojos me gritaban más de lo que yo mismo podía descifrar. Nunca te lo dije, pero eras asombrosa, pusiste de cabeza mi mundo sin siquiera pretenderlo.Llegaste un día, y me marcaste para siempre, fuiste la sorpresa y coincidencia que muy dentro de mí deseaba, y que un día después de tantos años se hizo realidad.Eras fuente de alegría siempre, amaba tu entusiasmo, las ganas que le ponías a todo, el empeño con el que siempre luchabas.No te lo dije, pero me enamoré de ti, me enamoré de tus gestos al hablar, y de la manera en la que me mirabas, me enamoré de la manera en la que me hacías sentir, porque no sabía que se podía sentir tanto en un segundo.Nunca te lo confesé, por idiota, por cobarde o por miedo a que fuera tan correspondido que no fuera posible.Tú nunca lo supiste, pero el día en que te fuiste mataste algo de mí, fuiste la lección más preciosa con la que pude toparme, y también una de las más dolorosas.Te fuiste un día, así sin más. Te despediste de mí y me abrazaste como si no hubiera futuro, aunque lo hubo, aunque no fuera el futuro juntos que deseábamos.Tal vez jamás leas esto, o tal vez jamás sepas que lo escribí, pero esta es la carta de despedida que siempre quise hacerte, pero que no hice. O al menos, que jamás te entregué.Fue el destino, la vida y la jodida suerte más precisa la que te trajo a mí, o la que me llevó hacía ti, de cualquier manera dejaste algo en mí que será por siempre inolvidable.Yo sé que no te dije tantas cosas, y me arrepiento, pero nunca olvides, que el amor tan intenso y prohibido que vivimos, jamás se podrá borrar, ni de mi mente, ni de la tuya.
El deseo de un soñador ." La sinfonía de mi alma.

He wants to break up with me after 8 years but I can’t. I’m living alone, sad every night, depressed, my grades are bad ,my life is falling down and I just sick of being depressed and can’t moving on , I wanna end me.=>I can’t imagine how hard that must be. Eight years is a long time. I am so sorry that this happened to you. My advice is to take it one day at a time. Everything will be different at first, but with time, it will get better. I can understand wanting to end your life over a guy, but let me tell you, it’s not worth it. No matter how much you loved him, it doesn’t matter because he’s not worth it no matter how great you think he is. He wouldn’t want you to either. Don’t give up. Depression is a hard thing to deal with.. I’ve had it for almost 10 years and it still gets to me sometimes. Just try your best to avoid being alone. Go out with friends and do fun things to distract your mind. I find that helps.

"O Naruto pode ser um pouco duro as vezes. Talvez você não saiba disso, mas o Naruto também cresceu sem pai.

Mesmo assim, eu nunca vi ele chorar, ficar zangado ou se dar por vencido, ele está sempre disposto a melhorar, ele quer ser respeitado, é o sonho dele, e o Naruto daria a vida por isso sem hesitar. Meu palpite é que ele se cansou de chorar e decidiu fazer alguma coisa a respeito!"

I ran for a while longer, then eventually changed back, wiped myself clean of any blo.od, learning from my mistakes, then heading back in. I was surprised to hear someone playing on the piano, but was not impressed to see who it was. I watched him for a second, jaw set.=>Kane played and he felt a pair of eyes on him that wasn’t Jezebel and Sapphires. He slowed to a stop, looking back at Natasha, looking away quickly but he didn’t get up. He didn’t want to. He went back to playing, the same song, a little bit louder. He was happy playing the piano, and he didn’t want to stop.
I nodded slowly, chuffing and then laying down with a long sigh. 'Ok.' I looked up at him with my head on my paws. 'If you need us, you do the same, ok?' I asked.=>“I will.” He nodded, leaning down to give her a quick pet. “See you later.” He said, getting out of the doorway to close the door behind him and go out front to his bike. He was gone within a few minutes, with the only ones left in the house being Sapphire, Jezebel, and Kane who was at the piano. He was playing around with it, but he did have some knowledge of how to play. It was less stressful to try since there was less people around.
I grogily lifted my head and shook out my fur, taking a second to get my bearings. It wasn't long before I was trotting back to the house. I didn't want to change yet. At least in this form, I couldn't let it slip. And I couldn't cry. 'They called you in?' I asked, sitting.=>“Yeah, one of my patients is back in for something we thought we fixed. He probably needs surgery, which means I’ll be in the hospital till my shift starts tonight. I won’t see you till tomorrow.” He explained, leaning in the doorway to look at her. “But you can come by the hospital if you need me. I’ll make time.” He promised.
I forced myself through the pain and ran for a long while. I chased things, k.illed a few tiny things, and let out a lot of emotion. I tore up a couple of trees like scratching posts and eventually fell asleep, curled up by the barn.=>Tristan inevitably got a call while he was planning out his strategy, so he got his things together to go to work. He poked his head out the back door and whistled, trying to see if he could get her attention. “Tash?!” He called, his voice echoing a bit in the backyard. “I’m going!”
I nodded slowly, trying to regain some amount of positivity but failing drastically. "Ok. Deal." I took a few steps back. "I'll see you inside."=>“Okay.” He said, turning to head back into the house. He didn’t really want to stop talking but he felt like if he kept going he’d just make it worse. But now he had to figure out how to tell Jezebel.
"No, I- I think..." I swallowed, hugging myself. "I think I'm gonna need some time. I'll run. I haven't run in a few days."=>“Okay.” He nodded, trying a small smile. “I’ll call for you if I get called into work.” He promised. “Deal?”
I shook my head. "Don't. It's not your fault. It... We-" I stopped, taking a breath. "Tristan, you could never let us down. Ever."=>“I’ll still think it.” Tristan shrugged, glancing back at the house and then looking back st her. “Think you’re ready to try and make a walk back?”
"Don't be ridiculous." I pulled back. "You're still you. You're still the same Tristan that saved me, Charlotte, Luke... All of us. You're still understanding and... Helpful and kind and..." It was getting a little hard to continue. "Soul or no soul, you're still you."=>“I just… I didn’t want to let you guys down. And with this… I feel like I am.” He shook his head. “I’m letting you guys down because I won’t be there.”
I pulled him back into another hug as the tears started falling thicker again now. "I'm sorry, Tristan. We should have done something. O-or noticed."=>“You couldn’t have noticed.” He said, shaking his head. “My power helped me leech off everybody’s emotions for so long but it’s getting exhausting. I wanted to tell you all before it got obvious I wasn’t… me.”
I looked up at him finally, frowning. I wasn't sobbing any more but that didn't mean tears weren't falling. "That's understandable. I'm sure I'll be mad at you too when I've had some time to get over the- the shock." I said, voice still shaking.=>“And you have every right to be.” He assured, nodding. “But I thought you ought to know. You’re one of the best friends I’ve had these past few years. It’s your right to know.”
It was definitely too soon. I covered my face and tried to wipe away a few tears. "What about Charlotte? What did she say?" I asked cautiously.=>“I told her the night of your birthday party.” He said, putting his hands in his pockets again. “She was upset, but she understood. I was yelled at a bit for not telling her sooner that something wasn’t right.” He said, shifting on his feet. “And yelled at because this could have been fixed, but when she calmed down she knew that she couldn’t change my mind.”
"Jezebel's gonna be mad." I said, a very weak scoff escaping me. I huffed, frowning. "You better tell them soon because I'm not gonna... I won't be able to keep it. I... When Luke gets back, I don't think..."=>“I’m telling her next.” He said, sighing. “I’m gonna need a protection spell on me so she doesn’t k.ill me before I do it myself.” He tried to be humorous but it seemed like it was too soon. “She’s gonna take it the hardest, I know.”
I nodded, hanging my head and trying to get myself together. Even if only a little bit. "And the others?" I asked quietly.=>“I’ll tell them soon. Now that it’s quieter, I can tell people individually.” He said, taking a small step back from her. Just enough to see through the window of the house. “Better now than anytime else.”
I nodded, but couldn't bring myself to meet his eye for long. Everything felt a little numb. "How long do you... When..." The question wasn't natural and neither was my delivery. How do you ask one of your closest friends when they intend on dyi.ng? "I'm sorry."=>“We talked about Christmastime, Maybe the end of the year.” Tristan said, knowing what she meant to ask. “It’s not solid yet but, I’ll know when I know.” Tristan knew it was selfish, the whole situation was selfish, but it was what he wanted. “And you’ll know as soon as I do.”
That made me cry for a different reason and I shook my head still. "Tristan... I... I want to believe that, you... I just- it..." Everything was a little much for me to be able to form proper sentences.=>“Take some time.” Tristan said, trying to find her eye. “I know I just threw a lot at you, but you needed to know.”
I sniffed, then sobbed to make up for it. "But... Can't we get your soul back? Or find you a new one? There has to be something..." I closed my eyes tight. "You have to outlive me too."=>That last line hurt him. He sighed and tried a small smile. “Maybe in another life.” He said, shaking his head. “In our religion, we believe that we get reincarnated somehow. We can become anything, any plant, any animal, or even be born again.” He said, trying to give her some hope. “Maybe I’ll come back and you get to teach me some things this time around.”
I kept shaking my head and hugged him again, needing it. "There has to be something else we can do." I mumbled.=>“I don’t want to do anything else.” He said honestly, shaking his head. “Tash, I’ve lived a decent life. Granted, my friends will probably outlive me tenfold, but I can’t keep living through other people’s feelings.”
"That's..." What was it? Good? Bad? Crazy? All of the above? I shook my head and tried to steady my breathing but it was in vain. "I wanna say I'm happy for you but..."=>“I know I… the situation sucks.” He said, looking at her with a sigh. “But I can’t live like this. I know it will hurt for everybody else when I tell them as well, but it’s sucks just as much for me, a person who can’t feel.”
I pulled back to look up at him, eyes and mouth wide. "Preg- Tristan, what?" I tried to wipe my eyes but that didn't help. I just sobbed more tears out.=>“We… well, she…” He was a bit flustered at the concept still. “She wants one more, so, we tried, but she hasn’t told me whether or not she’s pregnant for sure yet.”
I sobbed against him, shaking my head to the best of my ability. "I don't accept it. I can't..." I mumbled through the sobs.=>"I know, it's hard, but... I'm here for a few more months. Alright? It isn't goodbye just yet. I have to wait and see if Char is..."
He stopped himself but decided he had better tell it all to her now. There wouldn't be an easier time. "If she's pregnant again."
"There has to be something else." I begged, starting to cry now. "Please don't do this." I wrapped my arms around his waist tightly. I didn't want to let go. It was like it would be the last time.=>Tristan wrapped his arms around her and sighed, it hurt him to know how much it hurt her. “I…” He trailed off, squeezing her tighter. “I’m sorry.” He said quietly, tears falling now. Her feelings were so strong, he didn’t want to fight them. Not now.
"Tristan..." His name got caught in my throat and I shook my head, turning to him fully now. "No, y-you can't. What..." Tears stopped me as I looked up at him. "You can't."=>“I have to.” He said, and her feelings really strong he took some of them on. Tears came to his eyes. It would have been nice if the situation didn’t suck. “I know, I… it’s hard but I have to.” He nodded at her.
"Oh... So, what are we gonna do?" A feeling of dread came over me. I knew exactly what he was going to say but I wanted /anything/ else. I felt a lump rise to my throat and my ribs started to ache a little.=>He could feel exactly what she was and it made him uncomfortable. He gave her a small smile and shook his head. “You know the answer to that.” He said, a bit quieter. “I don’t want to go on like this. It’s been tolerable because of my power but I just… I can’t do this much longer.”
"What?" I asked through another nervous laugh, this one much less enthusiastic as I caught on to his morbid tone. "Without a soul? Well... How do we get it back?"=>“That’s the thing, Tash.” He said, taking a deep breath and stopping his walk. “I’ve talked to Char and I don’t think we’re going to get it back.” He said, taking his hands out of his pockets.
Furrowing my eyebrows, I gave a nervous laugh and looked up at him. "What do you mean?" I asked, head shaking.=>“There’s not really an easy way to say this, but I have to back up a bit so you know…” he sighed and slowed himself down a bit. “When I was brought back, I… didn’t have feelings. I still don’t. I just…” He sighed. “I don’t think I was brought back with a soul.”
