Te despediste de m� y me abrazaste como si no hubiera futuro, aunque lo hubo, aunque no fuera el futuro juntos que dese�bamos.Tal vez jam�s leas esto, o tal vez jam�s sepas que lo escrib�, pero esta es la carta de despedida que siempre quise hacerte, pero que no hice. O al menos, que jam�s te entregu�.Fue el destino, la vida y la jodida suerte m�s precisa la que te trajo a m�, o la que me llev� hac�a ti, de cualquier manera dejaste algo en m� que ser� por siempre inolvidable.Yo s� que no te dije tantas cosas, y me arrepiento, pero nunca olvides, que el amor tan intenso y prohibido que vivimos, jam�s se podr� borrar, ni de mi mente, ni de la tuya.\";;;;;;;;;', '\"El deseo de un so�ador .\"\" La sinfon�a de mi alma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\";;;;;;;;;', 'Hola te gustaria hablar horny o hacerme preguntas horny?

the responsibility of a woman, or her friends or family, especially the guy friends, males get protective of the pussy and I don't want more bullshit in my life, I don't think I'm enough for a woman as it is, I'm not worth their time, because I serve god, if I have to sin to be in a relationship then NO, I don't get why you girls think there is one I im in love with, I don't love anyone, the last time I allowed my idiot mind to fall, I fell on glass that scared my heart and that was when my parents proved a relationship is worthless by showing the pain that comes with one, I don't think I can love anyone because what has happened to me, the feeling of a broken heart and loneliness, divorce scars a child's mind, I don't think I can handle a woman unless she is loving and patient and does expect me to always make her happy, I'm not looking for a co dependency, I LOVE NO ONE, besides when women approach the show their body off, which means sex and for my heart that doesn't fufill my

unto him, he knows I had no choice in loving those around me and he knew just like with Christ that having a loving heart means you have to suffer, Jesus was heartbroken with man but still loved us enough to die for us in our suffering and sorrows, god knew my pain because to face depression with no psych meds, drugs, alcohol, or sex all my life and to face the reality of our world of sin and evil and remain calm takes faith, he thinks of me as a mighty warriors, I lead praise in my church and deliver people from demons and speak fluent spirit talk or tounges, oh how he loves us so much!, you asked this question right as I was beginning to break down and cry at the feet of the lord, honestly there might be good in timing, but no I am single and have been all of my days, I don't know talk or date and have never touched a woman and yes to live like that is due following god, but also the choices of the women around me making impossible to love them and know them without conforming to social order and being forced into sin, want a prom date, yes but god is more important than the sinful and evil, as of recent is has been like a knife in my heart and I have been emotional, but praise god!;;;;;;;;;\", \"Do you know people with whom you want to improve contact, but can't?Why can't you?Who are these people?=>No, your need for names are not necessary, I have turned on them to god in to obedience, and the Lord has made me know truth, I have hardened my heart too much to lust and be immoral with the rest of the lost, for I would be cursed to touch them in places used by others, for I would attain them and their demons, I can't love, and I can't lust so I shut myself up and give my life away to god, within 26 days I will walk clean out of a place of darkness, and have

You cant depend on other people to make you happy, you cant expect everyone to love you and neither can you expect people to always be there for you or be there at all. One thing I learned is put yourself first, do things that make you happy, learn to love yourself, depend on yourself. The only reason you would feel that way is if you depend on others too much for your happiness, love and everything else there is. Once you start living for yourself then I doubt the people that come and leave your life would affect you that much. I mean obviously it would hurt (A LOT DUDE) but you would have yourself and youll have an easier time getting over it.

Imo, once the trust is gone, what're you trying to save? I think losing trust falls in line with deceit. Being deceived is above all, the worst feeling someone can feel. Deceit is betrayal with a splash of a lot of lying. Deceit is the speech someone uses to manipulate someone. No one likes to look or feel stupid. Imagine getting to know someone and instead of writing memory on a blank sheet with truths, they write their lies. Everything she told you was a lie. She's afraid of opening pandora box where all the troubles of her world reside, But hope is in there too. Instead she warps her life to fit the fantasies of a sheltered adolescent. Avoiding the truth because it would throw everything shes done out the door. Miserable because she doesn't get what she needs or wants, so she becomes a slave, a tool, for others to exploit. There is nothing of value in her existence, to counterbalance life's troubles. Someone hiding is not some vital. When someone hides who they are to you, they hide who they are to themselves... deceit. And Being deceived and losing trust is earth shattering to say the least. You lose the trust in the emotional bond, which is the biggest thing, I believe. When you let your significant other know how vulnerable you are to them, emotionally. Thats the highest level of trust. You're essentially 'naked' around them, victim to how they feel about you. Feeling all that to just get taken advantage of makes you lose that trust in them, and probably future relationships too. Dont take the example that happened to me answer your question. Trust broken, comes in many ways. The people involved are the only ones who know how much of that broken trust can be mended. It's not the same being on the outside looking in. How much self worth does a person have? How much of the same punishment are you willing to take over a key relationship foundation. Trust can be built, again, but sometimes that can be slow and full of suffering. You'll always remember.;;;;;;;;;\", '\"Would you give someone you didn\\'t know advice if they asked or help someone you didn\\'t know if they seemed distressed?=>\"\"Would you give someone you didn\\'t know advice if they asked\"\"\";;;;;;;;;', \"Absolutely.

Sometimes people dont need handouts, some times they just need a hand up, whether it\\'s someone to listen or someone to talk to. Everyone get distressed. Its not the easiest thing to talk about.

I think that if someone thinks happiness is the end goal and they\\'ll be in happy thereforeafter, If you think happiness comes from being adored by others, or being with someone who will fill you with temporary feelings and words for a couple nights.. you never be happy. Happiness, like love, is forever moving, it wont stop for anyone. It\\'s not stagnant. Happiness is always searching for new. I\\'ve thought a lot about my happiness lately. I thought I had it, but The energy I was chasing had different plans. I got stagnant and the universe saw and ripped what I thought happiness was, away. I learned that I was happinest when I was chasing the energy, and I wasn\\'t being chased back. The universe saved me by destroying every bit of my sense of knowing someone. Happiness to me was knowing someone will always chase for my attention as much as I chase theirs, but that chase will never end. Thats the point. We will always bring something new to each other or learning something new for each other. Keeping each other moving with the universe that is happiness and love. Its swimming to a raft after falling out and pushing her closer because that person mattered more than anything else in that moment. Its doing small cute things to each other that makes one of them embarrassed. Its making the other person to center of attention to make them feel special. That was always my happiness. Chasing clever ways. Happines doesn\\'t come with a price, its means people will fearlessly put you into unexpectedly lows places. I learned this the hard way and it was the hardest lesson learned. I admit I have my faults. I\\'m no angel that let\\'s everyone know about myself and what I do.

The only way Jesus could undo the rules of the universe that the former servant (traitor) had invoked; that transgressions against God needed blood for atonement, specifically the blood of an unblemished life, one without sin, was to offer Himself as the sacrifice.;;;;;;;;', 'Jesus did this for His bride the church (how it is spoken of in scripture). Jesus died, knowing that the grave could not contain Him.

Jesus had far more splendor, far greater kingdoms, and far more power. Through Him the universe was created! Yet Jesus left that splendor and lived among us for roughly 36 years. He lived most of His life on earth as a carpenter, a role that would have given Him the career of a human creator in the time that he lived. He experienced everything we experience, except He was without sin, yet he was tempted far beyond how we are tempted. Jesus did this so he would understand us, understand the human experience. Jesus designed us, and he took the time to understand corrupted humans, the us that was broken by sin. He loved us!;;;;;;;;;', 'Jesus has at least 100 million angels, which is a number specifically mentioned in Revelation. Angels are above humans and human capabilities, and they were under His command. Jesus was only held to the cross by His love, and His desire to save a portion of His creation.

Even driving in the mountains is a lot more fun.;;;;;;;;;', 'While the beach is nice to relax on, I feel like if I lived in the mountains I could take a vacation to the beach occasionally and not miss out on anything. The only things that are beneficial for long term around a beach are running/walking on the beach, sailing, plus water power sports - especially things like wakeboarding if there is a sheltered waterway around where I would live. Water power sports are generally expensive to undertake. I also think without entertaining guests things like wakeboarding would become routine and less desirable. Sailing would be the biggest thing missed out on most likely.;;;;;;;;;', 'Around most of the USA, water sports are best during the summer.

The scenery in the mountains is also less likely to get old.;;;;;;;;;', 'If I married someone who had to teach 9 months out of the year from August till May, living in the mountains for those 9 months would always be enjoyable. Living on the beach in any place but Florida would not be enjoyable for those months.

New York has a notable lake among the mountains to me. However, for every other reason besides natural beauty upstate New York isn't necessarily a desirable place to live. It would be fine to visit.;;;;;;;;;\", \"How to deal with busy boyfriend?=>Mutually schedule 'quality' time.;;;;;;;;;\", \"You're planning a nice dinner party but could only invite 2 people.

I've been hard to relate to due to difficulties in my own life, and pretty much the entire time he's known me I've had the same problems that never change that have revolved around my relationship with Evonne, and they've been severe problems.

Zach has a solid relationship with Christ. We also both have technical backgrounds and went to the same school for the same major. Zach has similar non-religious ideals that I have as well, which is rare.

There was an opportunity like that in the past, but I was broke and wasn't able to get venture capital for an engineering project. Zach has had an interest in international missions. If I was very wealthy and could afford to hire him, we have missions interests and engineering skills in common. There is much that could be done with both if things ever worked out well for me and he was open to the idea.;;;;;;;;;\", \"Which city would you choose as capital of the world?=>I'm very confident that within 50 years from now Jerusalem will be the capital of the world. That is a very good thing in my viewpoint, but I won't be around to see it.;;;;;;;;;\", \"Someone you wanna meet right now or someone you miss right now?=>Maybe Evonne.

I don't live life like single guys in my generation. That makes it much harder to meet people.;;;;;;;;;\", \"Lastly, people who are supposed to be my friends get bought off by a certain individual and sell out on me - being more loyal to her than to me.

If I had a reason to stay that's much different then having a possibility of a reason to stay, with someone who keeps forgetting about me. It bothers me a lot to turn down a good opportunity for only the sake of hope - especially since the track record is absolutely dismal. If it was more than a distant hope it would really give me clarity to priorities in life. I guess tell me I matter (specific person here). At some point I have to pack up and leave for the sake of survival - apart from being spoken for. I really need to do that soon - I don't have resources to wait anymore. I need revenue imminently. If I stay here longer I'm going to have to be creative in figuring out ways to cover my bases - it's not going to be anything anywhere close to ideal. I really need clarity of where my life is going asap. I hate indirect interference which is the play of choice on your part. That gives me nothing but immense frustration and zero peace. You wouldn't like that if I did that to you! Also it completely wastes my life. I spend days working on making something work out and it gets supernaturally canceled (except not supernaturally). If my life is a continuing cycle of this it's immensely wasteful. Again, you really wouldn't like me if I did that to you! There's a golden rule in scripture that should be considered here!;;;;;;;;;\", '\"is love to the grave old-fashioned?=>It is the Christian way for people who believe in Christ. God especially doesn\\'t like when families split up, have infidelity, can\\'t get along, and can\\'t forgive. The people who suffer the most are the kids beyond the spiritual health of the once married. For anyone else, outside of Christ, it is only a path of wisdom. Often, people are too selfish to consider wisdom. If they don\\'t believe in God, then why not live a life centered on hedonism and pleasure?For Christians, forgiveness of others is a mandate to be forgiven by God. Embittered people forget that. As a Christian, you are supposed to bless your enemy and pray for those who persecute you. Pronouncing anything but blessings is not allowed (How can salt water and fresh water come from the same spring?).For a Christian, marriage is a reflection of the marriage of Jesus to the church. Jesus loved His bride so much that He died for her, providing a way for the marriage to occur. That is a great cost to purchase a bride. Christians should live in reflection of this. Jesus went to great lengths to make love possible, so should we.I could add a bunch of scripture. I got lazy for this post. Maybe I\\'ll do it later and update it.

Right now they\\'re chasing light reflections around my condo, which is better than nuzzling me constantly to get me to pet them.

My parent\\'s house is much better for the dogs with a yard that is perfect for dogs to play in. At my condo, the best I can do for them is take them on leashes on walks at a minimum of twice a day if I keep them overnight. Reagan also really likes watching TV at my parent\\'s house.

I think one of the most complex meals I cooked on an open fire (not gas) involved an apple pie, not pre-made. Apple Cider was very common for campout meals. If you aren't using a filter to collect water, you must boil it for a certain amount of time. Hot water to drink went well with apple cider powder and hot cocoa powder typically for me.;;;;;;;;;\", 'Fires were never special to me from my Boy Scout days on (5th grade?). On my parents property, I would go to great lengths to host people who I thought would appreciate fires and torches during the autumn or late summer, but I never enjoyed them. I was always running logistics trying to be a good host. I guess I never enjoyed a fall gathering because I was always trying to make everyone else comfortable.;;;;;;;;;', 'Camping to me was also year round. There were weekends in January where we would hike 14 miles in a weekend well below freezing. There was plenty of camping in the sweltering heat in the middle of the summer, with all kinds of insects to worry about.;;;;;;;;;', 'My favorite camping is in the mountains out west in the June time frame. I would love to repeat some of those experiences in Wyoming, Arizona, Utah, Montana, and Colorado that I had growing up.;;;;;;;;;', 'what ur favorite weather? season? do u like rain?=>My favorite weather is sunny but cool enough that you can have the windows of your house open, or having the right temperature outside that you sleep with your windows open during the summer. I liked all the lightening bugs that would fill the night air. There were some Augusts in Kentucky that were like this.;;;;;;;;;', \"I like Augusts and February or March. The best of summer or winter. Winter isn't winter without enough snow to do things like ski. Augusts at the lake in the Adirondacks are a favorite memory as well.;;;;;;;;;\", \"I don't like rain. I would rather be inside on a rainy day. Unless the rain punctuates a dry spell and is needed. I grew up a half mile from the Ohio river. Water was always plentiful. Even with hills, lots of rain would flood the lowlands next to the river, closing roads in the spring within 30 ft of the normal river level.;;;;;;;;;\", 'What is your favorite clothing store?=>I really liked Abercrombie from 10 years ago as casual style.;;;;;;;;;', 'I probably need to grow up.;;;;;;;;;', \"I really don't like effeminate styles for men, which seems popular right now. The skinny pants legs and short shorts stuff isn't even comfortable. All around bad.;;;;;;;;;\", \"There are places I like to buy clothes... I just don't think they're my personal brand.;;;;;;;;;\", 'I prefer classic styles to fads in general. I also like rugged looks when appropriate - like casually.;;;;;;;;;', \"For what I wear around my condo when no one sees me... I typically wear stuff from Galls. It's cheap, rugged, really comfortable, has lots of pockets, and I really don't care if I wear it out... unlike other clothes in my collection. If I had to do physical work, I would probably wear my stuff from Galls as well. The clothes are tactically oriented.;;;;;;;;;\", 'I have a tailor in South Korea I liked. He had made suits for George W. Bush, the CEO of Boeing, among other leaders. He had pictures with them in his suits, standing with them. Someday I would like to go back and see if he is still in business.;;;;;;;;;', 'What three things in life you want more than anything else?=>First, I want a life that honors God and serves Him with excellence. I want a life of faith for myself and my family. I want wisdom and discernment so that I can know what choices to make to live this life.;;;;;;;;;', 'Second, I want love in my life. A wife and kids. I want to have a solid family that loves each other and can depend on each other. I need this for personal stability, as it is something I have lived life both recently and to the distant past without, and it wears on me.;;;;;;;;;', 'Third, I want to have wealth, or in absence of wealth, success.;;;;;;;;;', '=>4;;;;;;;;;', ' 555=>;;;;;;;;;', '55=>;;;;;;;;;', ' =>ohmmmiee;;;;;;;;;', '555=>;;;;;;;;;', '=>Krai ar;;;;;;;;;', '!!!!=>;;;;;;;;;', '    =>5555;;;;;;;;;', ' => 170;;;;;;;;;', '???? =>;;;;;;;;;', ' =>555;;;;;;;;;', ' ?????=>555;;;;;;;;;', 'If someone made a statue of you, what position would you choose?=>JUST DO IT;;;;;;;;;', 'If you were an anime character.

      "\"is love to the grave old-fashioned?=>It is the Christian way for people who believe in Christ. God especially doesn't like when families split up, have infidelity, can't get along, and can't forgive. The people who suffer the most are the kids beyond the spiritual health of the once married. For anyone else, outside of Christ, it is only a path of wisdom. Often, people are too selfish to consider wisdom. If they don't believe in God, then why not live a life centered on hedonism and pleasure?For Christians, forgiveness of others is a mandate to be forgiven by God. Embittered people forget that. As a Christian, you are supposed to bless your enemy and pray for those who persecute you. Pronouncing anything but blessings is not allowed (How can salt water and fresh water come from the same spring?).For a Christian, marriage is a reflection of the marriage of Jesus to the church. Jesus loved His bride so much that He died for her, providing a way for the marriage to occur. That is a great cost to purchase a bride. Christians should live in reflection of this. Jesus went to great lengths to make love possible, so should we.I could add a bunch of scripture. I got lazy for this post. Maybe I'll do it later and update it. I tried to allude to the key phrases.I'm taking care of my parent's two dogs and cat for three weeks. I'm in the middle of that right now. I only write on my desktop in my condo. I come here for a max of 6 hours every day along with the two golden retrievers - Reagan & Maggie. They constantly want attention. Right now they're chasing light reflections around my condo, which is better than nuzzling me constantly to get me to pet them. My condo is too small for the pets to do anything but visit for short periods of time. They get bored too easily. There's no windows low enough for them to look out when it's cold (I can open my front door, but it gets drafty with the glass/screen door (leaks) and today for instance is one of KY's colder days of the year.). My parent's house is much better for the dogs with a yard that is perfect for dogs to play in. At my condo, the best I can do for them is take them on leashes on walks at a minimum of twice a day if I keep them overnight. Reagan also really likes watching TV at my parent's house. He even can determine the good/bad guys in a movie and will lend his support against the bad guys. lol. We have to tell him \"\"It's on TV, It's on TV.\"\"\";;;;;;;;;\n",
