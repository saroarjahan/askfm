      "\"is love to the grave old-fashioned?=>It is the Christian way for people who believe in Christ. God especially doesn't like when families split up, have infidelity, can't get along, and can't forgive. The people who suffer the most are the kids beyond the spiritual health of the once married. For anyone else, outside of Christ, it is only a path of wisdom. Often, people are too selfish to consider wisdom. If they don't believe in God, then why not live a life centered on hedonism and pleasure?For Christians, forgiveness of others is a mandate to be forgiven by God. Embittered people forget that. As a Christian, you are supposed to bless your enemy and pray for those who persecute you. Pronouncing anything but blessings is not allowed (How can salt water and fresh water come from the same spring?).For a Christian, marriage is a reflection of the marriage of Jesus to the church. Jesus loved His bride so much that He died for her, providing a way for the marriage to occur. That is a great cost to purchase a bride. Christians should live in reflection of this. Jesus went to great lengths to make love possible, so should we.I could add a bunch of scripture. I got lazy for this post. Maybe I'll do it later and update it. I tried to allude to the key phrases.I'm taking care of my parent's two dogs and cat for three weeks. I'm in the middle of that right now. I only write on my desktop in my condo. I come here for a max of 6 hours every day along with the two golden retrievers - Reagan & Maggie. They constantly want attention. Right now they're chasing light reflections around my condo, which is better than nuzzling me constantly to get me to pet them. My condo is too small for the pets to do anything but visit for short periods of time. They get bored too easily. There's no windows low enough for them to look out when it's cold (I can open my front door, but it gets drafty with the glass/screen door (leaks) and today for instance is one of KY's colder days of the year.). My parent's house is much better for the dogs with a yard that is perfect for dogs to play in. At my condo, the best I can do for them is take them on leashes on walks at a minimum of twice a day if I keep them overnight. Reagan also really likes watching TV at my parent's house. He even can determine the good/bad guys in a movie and will lend his support against the bad guys. lol. We have to tell him \"\"It's on TV, It's on TV.\"\"\";;;;;;;;;\n",
