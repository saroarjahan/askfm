      "I understand what you were trying to do, but I don't think I can process that possibility yet. I mean it's been an eternity since Frisk k!lled me, this whole time I've thought everyone was completely gone=>I am sorry dear..do you maybe need some time alone or..I wasn't exactly trying to upset you or put you in a state of shock like that..just ignore what I've said..would you like some tea?\n",

Don't you think maybe that applies to the rest of the monsters from your timeline? Your Papyrus is responsible for all the others, so is your Toriel, your Grillby..we wouldn't be here if they were completely erased from existence\n",

MY brother was erased from the multiverse...=>It is true your timeline was erased and your brother is no longer physically here but he wasn't entirely erased, that is where your wrong, why do you think our AU was created? Where do the Souls have to go when monsters dust and are unable to come back? They have to go somewhere, that's where our AU came in\n",

I'm sorry Death is so careless and nearly made you sushi *she glares at the Death God*\n",

      "Hey Tori, I need another favor, I kílled Grillbys daughter on accident, can you bring her back?=>Why is it everytime you or your family come to visit it has to do with YOU kílling someone? You really ARE a abomination like I first thought! I'll bring her back but STOP KlLLING INOCCENT MONSTERS!\n",
      "Tor at one point on the save screen I was going to end the Alpha timeline forever to protect Papyrus, if I had done that the entire Multiverse would have collapsed on itself, but I didn't care. I wasn't \"right\" after all that time, I honestly thought non-existence was better than the endless resets=>*Toriel sighed* We all have done things we aren't proud of, the important thing is you learned that wasn't the right decision, it's nice you loved your brother that much you wanted to protect him but that wasn't the right way to do so\n",
      "I'm still with Reaper, I think that's proof that something is wrong with me *Geno chuckles*=>*Toriel laughs slightly* I think there's something wrong more so with Reaper than you dear, at least you don't go around kílling everything you come in contact with\n",
      "You could say that... But then again, this is America so you have your freedom of speech!=>*Not with Trump anymore lol I have no regrets about what I said, I hate Trump*\n",

      "do you open up for people first or ??=>No but this time I will open up, in faith through Christ, I am adulterous, and I have spent money on things with livecams, female of course. I do not say this to validate the righteousness of others, I say to be healed of my sins, the Lord says to confess your sins and be healed, and I am broken in my relationships with the opposite gender, I have had almost a hatred for the opposite gender, was looking for love in those who only wanted to have sex, my heart became numbed to the seduction of a woman, and wanted to give up hope, depression and anxiety dragged me through the ground, my mother's Constant yelling through the years shattered my idea of what a normal woman Is like, until tonight, a woman who is a child of the lord reached out to me with a kindness and acted with that in her heart, there is hope, but those who attempt to seduce me will face a stone heart and a mind protected by god, I have battles to win within myself and he has overcome the world, praise god, and love Jesus Christ\n",

What do you do when your own family isn't even there for you anymore?☹=>you’re asking the wrong person bc i’m not in a good place myself right now. What I can tell you though is think of it this way; all of us are alone at the end of the day no matter if you’re actually alone or you have ton of friends. You can’t depend on other people to make you happy, you can’t expect everyone to love you and neither can you expect people to always be there for you or be there at all. One thing I learned is put yourself first, do things that make you happy, learn to love yourself, depend on yourself. The only reason you would feel that way is if you depend on others too much for your happiness, love and everything else there is. Once you start living for yourself then I doubt the people that come and leave your life would affect you that much. I mean obviously it would hurt (A LOT DUDE) but you would have yourself and you’ll have an easier time getting over it. Knowing for yourself that you don’t need to depend on anyone to make you happy is honestly is a great feeling. Especially when it’s a person who’s toxic. It’s something that takes time but it’s definitely worth it.\n",

Felt like nothing I do is right and even if it was right I didn't get any joy out of it. My entire world turned every single way.\n",
      "What did I do...? Welp...I hit rockbottom and had to realize the absolute importance of a God that I did not want to believe.

Asked my dad for books and studies to help me figure things out.\n",
      "What were the main causes for your sadness and depression?=>I started focusing on me. Started getting obsessed with what I wanted and my goals. My desires. My feelings. Instead of letting God lead and doing what I thought He would want for me. I started hanging around the wrong people. People who did not lift me up and keep me accountable. This led to me being extremely focused on what the world thought of me instead of what God thought.\n",
      "Which do you think is more important: following the dreams your parents want for you or following your own dreams?=>Your own. With respect to your parents. They will get over it sometime and see that you are doing what you think is best for you. That is all you can do.\n",

      "why do those who want love get tears?=>You want love so badly that you choose someone who will hurt you and try to rationalize the red flags. My advice, protect yourself and be smart. Do not fall for someone just because you are lonely. Wait for the person that loves you back.\n",
      "What's the coolest thing you've ever seen in a museum?=>An almost perfectly embalmed mummy. Still had hair, teeth, most of the face and nails. Very creepy but also extremely awesome\n",
      "Many professors can't explain whether soul exists as such, and if it exists, then what is it and where is it located. Do you think there is soul and if so, where is it located?=>I think the soul exists. It is our spiritual body. Not like “energy” and “chakras” but a Biblical sense. When our phsyical bodies die, our spiritual bodies go immediately to the final judgement of God. When he judges all of humanity and sends everyone to heaven or hell forever, that will be our spiritual body.\n",
      "This is all based off of belief and what very little I know about this. I have no idea where it is located or if there is some way to “see” it. All I know is it is real and that it exists outside of our physical timeline.\n",
      "What is the purpose of your existence?=>The single purpose of all existance is to bring glory to God. It is our job to figure out how we can best do that within the boundaries of our lives’\n",
      "What do you love the most? Please answer=>My God, my family, myself, and the girl I bought a cookie for.\n",
      "Why fairy tales are told to children?=>To keep their imagination alive. The single most important thing to a child is his/her imagination.\n",
      "Guess, what is it: four in the office, and one working?=>My work!! Hahaha but umm hands. Like a secretary taking notes with one hand while the person dictates.\n",
      "Do you think kids our age can be in love?=>Depends on your age, but my age yes. Whether we are ready for that love is the better question.\n",
      "What hour do you usually go to bed and how many hours do you sleep every night? Have you had nights when you didn't sleep at all?=>Usually try to shut everything off around 11, work days I sleep till 5 am. There have been several nights when I don't get any sleep and some nights where I sleep so deeply I can barely get up😂\n",
      "Do you believe the devil exists?=>Yes, if you want to get really Biblical, I am not sure if he is actually on Earth like Jesus was or if that will be an “Endtimes only debut”. But yes, he does exist and anyone who says otherwise is lying to you.\n",
      "Have people whom you trusted and cared for, said lies about you or humiliated you? How did you deal with the situation?=>Yes, I got out of the situation. Left, bye Felicia. That is not the kind of person/s that you want to be around.\n",
      "Post something for your best friend ?=>Whoever you are best friend! You are the best\n",
      "Two people that flirt a lot and it's obvious that they like eachother?=>Dudes! Just get over yourselves and ask!! Lol like seriously, even if both of you ask the other out at the exact same time and stumble over each other, that will be a heck of a lot better than no one saying anything.\n",
      "Do you have any advice for people starting out on youtube?=>My advice is very pessimistic because I did not have a good experience with YouTube at all. Personally, I would say don't do it. But if you are set on starting, build a network. Get good, catchy music in your videos. Stick to the point and do it quickly. And have a goal. Have a vision that you can strive for. In short, make it a channel that you would want to watch and follow.\n",
      "You have an opportunity to make one person absolutely happy, but not yourself. Who=>Someone who I bought a cookie for😂. If she is reading this, you deserve all the happiness👍\n",
      "What is your very definition of, love?=>Love is an emotion you feel when you are attached to someone. You can love your father, mother, sister, brother, cousin, uncle,. This is a close, family kind of love.\n",
      "You can also love another, unrelated person like a friend or coworker.\n",
      "But my definition of love is: a romantic and/or relational connection one feels towards another human that is strengthened by emotional attachment.\n",
      "What are the three most important things for you to be happy?💫⭐=>Love, God (no one is forcing you to believe in GOD but at the very least something higher and more important than ourselves), and a family or someone that cares about you.\n"

      "저는 고3때까진 한국 대학 입시하다가 재수때는 오로지 유학준비를 위해 학원 다녔었습니다~\n",
      "노원 가우디 학원이라고 노원역 쪽에 만화 애니 학원 있는데 원장 선생님께서 직접 칼아츠 링링 외 여러 대학들도 직접 발로 뛰시면서 정보 모으시고...진짜 대단하신 원장 선생님 한분이 계십니다!! 유학 관련해서 정보는 완전 빠삭하다고 보시면 되실거같아요~\n",

      "예중 예고는 본인 소양이나 실력을 쌓을수있는 곳이라면 어디든 상관없습니다. 예중예고라고 가산점이 붙거나 그러지는 않습니다~ 오로지 포트폴리오의 완성도, 실력만 봅니다.\n",
      "안녕하세요!! 칼아츠에 대해서 찾아보다가 우연히 들어왔는데 보실지 모르겠네요ㅠㅠ 16살때 부터 미국으로 대학교 가는 것을 생각해오면서 공부를 했는데 (유학준비하는 대안학교에서) 저는 지금 19살이 되었어요. 그전부터 미술쪽에 관심이 있었는데 최근에 애니메이션 쪽으로 전공을 하고싶어서 알아보다가 칼아츠를 알게되었는데 포트폴리오 준비방법이나 입학 경쟁률, 한국학생 수, 교양과목은 뭐가 있는지 알려주실수 있나요??=>자세한 포트폴리오 준비 방법은 학교 홈페이지를 참고해주세요! (https://calarts.edu/admissions/portfolio-audition-requirements/film-video/character-animation) 자세히 전부다 나와있습니다!\n",

      "If the Trust is gone from a relationship, can the relationship ever be saved?=>. Imo, once the trust is gone, what're you trying to save? I think losing trust falls in line with deceit. Being deceived is above all, the worst feeling someone can feel. Deceit is betrayal with a splash of a lot of lying. Deceit is the speech someone uses to manipulate someone. No one likes to look or feel stupid. Imagine getting to know someone and instead of writing memory on a blank sheet with truths, they write their lies. Everything she told you was a lie. She's afraid of opening pandora box where all the troubles of her world reside, But hope is in there too. Instead she warps her life to fit the fantasies of a sheltered adolescent. Avoiding the truth because it would throw everything shes done out the door. Miserable because she doesn't get what she needs or wants, so she becomes a slave, a tool, for others to exploit. There is nothing of value in her existence, to counterbalance life's troubles. Someone hiding is not some vital. When someone hides who they are to you, they hide who they are to themselves... deceit. And Being deceived and losing trust is earth shattering to say the least. You lose the trust in the emotional bond, which is the biggest thing, I believe. When you let your significant other know how vulnerable you are to them, emotionally. Thats the highest level of trust. You're essentially 'naked' around them, victim to how they feel about you. Feeling all that to just get taken advantage of makes you lose that trust in them, and probably future relationships too. Dont take the example that happened to me answer your question. Trust broken, comes in many ways. The people involved are the only ones who know how much of that broken trust can be mended. It's not the same being on the outside looking in. How much self worth does a person have? How much of the same punishment are you willing to take over a key relationship foundation. Trust can be built, again, but sometimes that can be slow and full of suffering. You'll always remember.\n",

      "Would you give someone you didn't know advice if they asked or help someone you didn't know if they seemed distressed?=>\"Would you give someone you didn't know advice if they asked\"\n",
      "Absolutely. I would hope as far as telling you to get advice from people outside your circle. Friends have your best interest and I think they will tell you what you want to hear, instead of what you need to hear...generally. Asking a stranger is always a good thing because they aren't biased in their opinion/answer. Strangers are the best neutral that you will find.\n",
      "\"or help someone you didn't know if they seemed distressed?\"\n",
      "Yes. Sometimes people dont need handouts, some times they just need a hand up, whether it's someone to listen or someone to talk to. Everyone get distressed. Its not the easiest thing to talk about. I know for myself, it's always nice having someone just to \"listen\"\n",

      "What is the meaning of happiness!!????=>Judging from the amount \"! ?'s\" you took the time to type,i wont give you a generic answer. I'll give ya the best of my ability truth, and not a lie. I think that if someone thinks happiness is the end goal and they'll be in happy thereforeafter, If you think happiness comes from being adored by others, or being with someone who will fill you with temporary feelings and words for a couple nights.. you never be happy. Happiness, like love, is forever moving, it wont stop for anyone. It's not stagnant. Happiness is always searching for new. I've thought a lot about my happiness lately. I thought I had it, but The energy I was chasing had different plans. I got stagnant and the universe saw and ripped what I thought happiness was, away. I learned that I was happinest when I was chasing the energy, and I wasn't being chased back. The universe saved me by destroying every bit of my sense of knowing someone. Happiness to me was knowing someone will always chase for my attention as much as I chase theirs, but that chase will never end. Thats the point. We will always bring something new to each other or learning something new for each other. Keeping each other moving with the universe that is happiness and love. Its swimming to a raft after falling out and pushing her closer because that person mattered more than anything else in that moment. Its doing small cute things to each other that makes one of them embarrassed. Its making the other person to center of attention to make them feel special. That was always my happiness. Chasing clever ways. Happines doesn't come with a price, its means people will fearlessly put you into unexpectedly lows places. I learned this the hard way and it was the hardest lesson learned. I admit I have my faults. I'm no angel that let's everyone know about myself and what I do. Most importantly, I have learned what brings me happiness, but I'm still learning and the class has empty seats. Apologizing for my wrongs was my first step\n",

      "Jesus, whom scriptures say created the world as well as man as the instrument of God who everything was created by, loved His creation so much that when His creation was sabotaged by a former servant and then destined to death and destruction, the creator sought to save His creation. The only way Jesus could undo the rules of the universe that the former servant (traitor) had invoked; that transgressions against God needed blood for atonement, specifically the blood of an unblemished life, one without sin, was to offer Himself as the sacrifice.\n",
      "Jesus did this for His bride the church (how it is spoken of in scripture). Jesus died, knowing that the grave could not contain Him. Jesus died so that the redeemed, those that lived for Him and claimed His blood over their transgressions, could collectively become His bride! Jesus loved us as a whole so much that he died for us, so he could marry us!\n",
      "The thing is Jesus is God - when He experienced death for our sins, He tasted death for each of us. Being God, he will never forget His suffering at the hands of the servant who betrayed Him (Satan). When you claim Jesus blood to cover your sins, Jesus experiences the punishment you deserved yet he received. It is through his suffering that we are made right with God.\n",
      "Jesus has great power, He could have destroyed the creation that was made by His hands and start from scratch and recreate the world. However, Jesus desired us in our brokenness and our broken world, and desired to fix us rather than throw us away!\n",
      "Imagine the most powerful, richest man in the world. Jesus had far more splendor, far greater kingdoms, and far more power. Through Him the universe was created! Yet Jesus left that splendor and lived among us for roughly 36 years. He lived most of His life on earth as a carpenter, a role that would have given Him the career of a human creator in the time that he lived. He experienced everything we experience, except He was without sin, yet he was tempted far beyond how we are tempted. Jesus did this so he would understand us, understand the human experience. Jesus designed us, and he took the time to understand corrupted humans, the us that was broken by sin. He loved us!\n",
      "Jesus has at least 100 million angels, which is a number specifically mentioned in Revelation. Angels are above humans and human capabilities, and they were under His command. Jesus was only held to the cross by His love, and His desire to save a portion of His creation. He could have commanded his angels to rescue Him, he had at least a 2/3rds advantage over the traitors forces, yet Jesus was held there in humiliation and suffering for our benefit!\n",
      "Christian men are instructed to love their wives as Christ loved the church, for their is no greater example of sacrificial love, and no greater story of defeating an enemy, for the grave could not contain him. Satan's power was broken.\n",

      "How would you like to be remembered?👀=>If I'm going to die soon I would prefer to be martyred. Other then that I don't think much else matters.\n",
      "If this was a long term question, I would want to be regarded as a man who had faith in Christ and lived it out.\n",
      "Would you rather live in the mountains or on the beach?=>I would rather live in the mountains. I enjoy skiing, backpacking, hiking, the scenery, and general adventures mountains enable. Even driving in the mountains is a lot more fun.\n",
      "While the beach is nice to relax on, I feel like if I lived in the mountains I could take a vacation to the beach occasionally and not miss out on anything. The only things that are beneficial for long term around a beach are running/walking on the beach, sailing, plus water power sports - especially things like wakeboarding if there is a sheltered waterway around where I would live. Water power sports are generally expensive to undertake. I also think without entertaining guests things like wakeboarding would become routine and less desirable. Sailing would be the biggest thing missed out on most likely.\n",
      "Around most of the USA, water sports are best during the summer. Sports among the mountains can be enjoyed year round.\n",
      "I feel like there is much more adventure in the mountains. The scenery in the mountains is also less likely to get old.\n",
      "If I married someone who had to teach 9 months out of the year from August till May, living in the mountains for those 9 months would always be enjoyable. Living on the beach in any place but Florida would not be enjoyable for those months. If I married a teacher and if summer was vacation time, we could then choose to visit any beach we wanted during peak season for the beach.\n",
      "I think mountains during the summer can be exciting though too.\n",
      "There are places that have a giant lake and mountains, but the likelihood of ending up in someplace like that is very low. New York has a notable lake among the mountains to me. However, for every other reason besides natural beauty upstate New York isn't necessarily a desirable place to live. It would be fine to visit.\n",

      "How to deal with busy boyfriend?=>Mutually schedule 'quality' time.\n",
      "You're planning a nice dinner party but could only invite 2 people. Who would you invite?=>I would pick Evonne, I don't know who else would fit if I had to spend a pick on her.. If the intention was two couples already including Evonne and I, I would consider the Scotts.\n",
      "I don't care if Zach doesn't think of me often now. I've been hard to relate to due to difficulties in my own life, and pretty much the entire time he's known me I've had the same problems that never change that have revolved around my relationship with Evonne, and they've been severe problems. Zach has tried to constructively help me some in my troubles, and that is unique among people I know. I very much appreciated that.\n",
      "I need Christian friends. Zach has a solid relationship with Christ. We also both have technical backgrounds and went to the same school for the same major. Zach has similar non-religious ideals that I have as well, which is rare. I think we have some interests (hobbies) in common, or at least they would be hobbies I would pursue if my life was more normal.\n",
      "I appreciate Zach enough that if I ever became very wealthy I would want to hire him to work with me on stuff. There was an opportunity like that in the past, but I was broke and wasn't able to get venture capital for an engineering project. Zach has had an interest in international missions. If I was very wealthy and could afford to hire him, we have missions interests and engineering skills in common. There is much that could be done with both if things ever worked out well for me and he was open to the idea.\n",

      "Someone you wanna meet right now or someone you miss right now?=>Maybe Evonne. I bought her some flowers for her birthday this weekend. I doubt she'll say anything to me except through twitter... which is kinda cheap. We'll see.\n",
      "Do you know people with whom you want to improve contact, but can't?Why can't you?Who are these people?=>I had a few friends in a previous life.\n",
      "Nobody understands my life. People don't believe me when I speak about it. Everyone takes a critical view. I'm also embarrassed about how my life has turned out. Everything I've invested in hasn't worked out. People can't respect me. Both the central person responsible for wrecking my life, but also everyone else. I'm an anomaly and no one understands me.\n",
      "People relate to people that are like them. I'm very different - both my base self and also because nothing's worked out in my life. I feel like most people can't relate to me.\n",
      "I had a few friends who were similar to me intellectually, but their lives all progressed like standard lives for intellectuals and my life got stuck. They have all had success that I haven't had, they all have families of their own, and I'm just extra.\n",
      "Also most people in my generation don't have a relationship with Christ, and that's very important to me. I don't live life like single guys in my generation. That makes it much harder to meet people.\n",
      "Lastly, people who are supposed to be my friends get bought off by a certain individual and sell out on me - being more loyal to her than to me. That pushes me towards isolation as well. That should be off limits to said person. She needs to mind her own business. She also needs to deal directly with me rather than everyone else.... what she's done is just another degree of wrecking my life.\n",
      "After all that's happened to me, I'd pretty much rather be alone until something works out in my life. I get really tired of defending my life. No one understands. No one believes me either. I'm viewed as the problem, and that gets quite old.\n",

      "What's the way out of labyrinth of troubles??=>I see a couple of paths. I might re-answer this in the future when I have time to write some more.\n",
      "I basically can count on zero external support. I will have to fight a great deal of external interference.\n",
      "The desired outcome is to be told I matter to someone.\n",
      "However, if things repeat as they always do, the strategy will be Boyd Cycling the opposition (OODA (Observe - Orient - Decide - Act) Loops) until something falls through the cracks. I successfully did this in 2018. Believe me, I saw what was happening, similar pattern now. Not fair or respectful at all, but it can be done. It would be much more preferred to be treated as a human being. What is done typically is unheard of cruel to do to an enemy. I guess you have the resources that you answer to no one.\n",
      "What specials do you have next quarter?=>I have a potential beach trip 3rd week of June. It's with my extended family on my dad's side minus cousins for the most part. This is completely tentative for me. If I had a significant other and no conflicts it would be good to make a showing for my grandmother's birthday dinner to meet people - this won't/can't continue much farther into the future. I could make a couple days interesting perhaps as well beyond that, but it would be entirely optional.\n",
      "I also have a conference I'll likely go to April 26th and 27th. If I had a significant other I would try to pitch this to them (It's my favorite topic with a bunch of people I have a lot of respect for.), but it's not so important... I think that's potential crunch time for someone. I would go either way, unless there's some significantly important thing I'm invited to.\n",
      "Someone should invite me to things if I'm important, the sooner the better. I get calls all the time with people wanting to take me out of state professionally. If I had a reason to stay that's much different then having a possibility of a reason to stay, with someone who keeps forgetting about me. It bothers me a lot to turn down a good opportunity for only the sake of hope - especially since the track record is absolutely dismal. If it was more than a distant hope it would really give me clarity to priorities in life. I guess tell me I matter (specific person here). At some point I have to pack up and leave for the sake of survival - apart from being spoken for. I really need to do that soon - I don't have resources to wait anymore. I need revenue imminently. If I stay here longer I'm going to have to be creative in figuring out ways to cover my bases - it's not going to be anything anywhere close to ideal. I really need clarity of where my life is going asap. I hate indirect interference which is the play of choice on your part. That gives me nothing but immense frustration and zero peace. You wouldn't like that if I did that to you! Also it completely wastes my life. I spend days working on making something work out and it gets supernaturally canceled (except not supernaturally). If my life is a continuing cycle of this it's immensely wasteful. Again, you really wouldn't like me if I did that to you! There's a golden rule in scripture that should be considered here!\n",

      "is love to the grave old-fashioned?=>It is the Christian way for people who believe in Christ. God especially doesn't like when families split up, have infidelity, can't get along, and can't forgive. The people who suffer the most are the kids beyond the spiritual health of the once married. For anyone else, outside of Christ, it is only a path of wisdom. Often, people are too selfish to consider wisdom. If they don't believe in God, then why not live a life centered on hedonism and pleasure?For Christians, forgiveness of others is a mandate to be forgiven by God. Embittered people forget that. As a Christian, you are supposed to bless your enemy and pray for those who persecute you. Pronouncing anything but blessings is not allowed (How can salt water and fresh water come from the same spring?).For a Christian, marriage is a reflection of the marriage of Jesus to the church. Jesus loved His bride so much that He died for her, providing a way for the marriage to occur. That is a great cost to purchase a bride. Christians should live in reflection of this. Jesus went to great lengths to make love possible, so should we.I could add a bunch of scripture. I got lazy for this post. Maybe I'll do it later and update it. I tried to allude to the key phrases.I'm taking care of my parent's two dogs and cat for three weeks. I'm in the middle of that right now. I only write on my desktop in my condo. I come here for a max of 6 hours every day along with the two golden retrievers - Reagan & Maggie. They constantly want attention. Right now they're chasing light reflections around my condo, which is better than nuzzling me constantly to get me to pet them. My condo is too small for the pets to do anything but visit for short periods of time. They get bored too easily. There's no windows low enough for them to look out when it's cold (I can open my front door, but it gets drafty with the glass/screen door (leaks) and today for instance is one of KY's colder days of the year.). My parent's house is much better for the dogs with a yard that is perfect for dogs to play in. At my condo, the best I can do for them is take them on leashes on walks at a minimum of twice a day if I keep them overnight. Reagan also really likes watching TV at my parent's house. He even can determine the good/bad guys in a movie and will lend his support against the bad guys. lol. We have to tell him \"It's on TV, It's on TV.\"\n",

      "Who do you like?=>A girl named Evonne that I met at Cedarville. This has been going on 12 years. She doesn't treat me respectfully or how she would want to be treated - about the opposite in fact. I'm about to lose my patience. My life has been about completely wrecked by things she does or has done. She doesn't care about that. She is completely self-absorbed. I'm pretty much completely on my own. She has never stuck up for me. I see very little positives anymore.\n",
      "I don't know why I'm still here. She has blown every chance I have given her. The relationship is highly abusive because of what she does. I can't go into details because know one would believe me.\n",
      "Supposedly she is going to be less self-absorbed in the coming months due to an event.\n",
      "If that's not the case I'm gone.\n",

      "what r ur favorite activities u do in autumn?=>Normal people associate autumns with spending time outside such as around a fire cooking things.\n",
      "I am an Eagle Scout. I built fires and cooked things much more complex on them than hot dogs on a monthly basis - typically one weekend a month. I think one of the most complex meals I cooked on an open fire (not gas) involved an apple pie, not pre-made. Apple Cider was very common for campout meals. If you aren't using a filter to collect water, you must boil it for a certain amount of time. Hot water to drink went well with apple cider powder and hot cocoa powder typically for me.\n",
      "Fires were never special to me from my Boy Scout days on (5th grade?). On my parents property, I would go to great lengths to host people who I thought would appreciate fires and torches during the autumn or late summer, but I never enjoyed them. I was always running logistics trying to be a good host. I guess I never enjoyed a fall gathering because I was always trying to make everyone else comfortable.\n",
      "Camping to me was also year round. There were weekends in January where we would hike 14 miles in a weekend well below freezing. There was plenty of camping in the sweltering heat in the middle of the summer, with all kinds of insects to worry about.\n",
      "My favorite camping is in the mountains out west in the June time frame. I would love to repeat some of those experiences in Wyoming, Arizona, Utah, Montana, and Colorado that I had growing up.\n",

      "what ur favorite weather? season? do u like rain?=>My favorite weather is sunny but cool enough that you can have the windows of your house open, or having the right temperature outside that you sleep with your windows open during the summer. I liked all the lightening bugs that would fill the night air. There were some Augusts in Kentucky that were like this.\n",
      "I like Augusts and February or March. The best of summer or winter. Winter isn't winter without enough snow to do things like ski. Augusts at the lake in the Adirondacks are a favorite memory as well.\n",
      "I don't like rain. I would rather be inside on a rainy day. Unless the rain punctuates a dry spell and is needed. I grew up a half mile from the Ohio river. Water was always plentiful. Even with hills, lots of rain would flood the lowlands next to the river, closing roads in the spring within 30 ft of the normal river level.\n",

      "What is your favorite clothing store?=>I really liked Abercrombie from 10 years ago as casual style.\n",
      "I probably need to grow up.\n",
      "I really don't like effeminate styles for men, which seems popular right now. The skinny pants legs and short shorts stuff isn't even comfortable. All around bad.\n",
      "There are places I like to buy clothes... I just don't think they're my personal brand.\n",
      "I prefer classic styles to fads in general. I also like rugged looks when appropriate - like casually.\n",
      "For what I wear around my condo when no one sees me... I typically wear stuff from Galls. It's cheap, rugged, really comfortable, has lots of pockets, and I really don't care if I wear it out... unlike other clothes in my collection. If I had to do physical work, I would probably wear my stuff from Galls as well. The clothes are tactically oriented.\n",
      "I have a tailor in South Korea I liked. He had made suits for George W. Bush, the CEO of Boeing, among other leaders. He had pictures with them in his suits, standing with them. Someday I would like to go back and see if he is still in business.\n",

      "Second, I want love in my life. A wife and kids. I want to have a solid family that loves each other and can depend on each other. I need this for personal stability, as it is something I have lived life both recently and to the distant past without, and it wears on me.\n",
      "Third, I want to have wealth, or in absence of wealth, success.\n"

He got upset and said I’m making him a maid and we should clean together. He feels emasculated. What did I do wrong here?=>Not necessarily “wrong”, but you’re not on the same page as husband. From his response, he sees housework as woman’s work or lowly work, hence his reference to making him a maid.\n",
      "He’ll HELP you do it because he thinks he’s being nice, but to take on the primary responsibilities of maintaining the house while you work? He’s not about that housewife/husband life and he’s comfortable with you working all day and coming home to split cleaning with him while he doesn’t work out of preservation of his ego. Also, he would prefer to work and “feel like a man”. Taking care of the house isn’t a role he respects and makes him feel less than.\n",
      "He obviously has steady gender roles in head about what women and men should do (hence feeling emasculated by being asked to do housework.) You can ask him why he feels caring for the house he lives in is emasculating and unpack that. Maybe try explaining to him that you don’t see anything emasculating or demeaning about maintaining the house. And you can break down the work hours for him, that best case scenario, he’s essentially asking you to do 75% of the work to maintain the house (the job + half the housework) while he does 25%.\n",

You don’t have to accept everything.\n",

      "Obviously, he should have made his feelings very plain and allowed time for you BOTH to work on his concerns. There’s definitely been a huge breakdown in communication on both ends.\n",
      "Some folks just say enough and go. You’re supposed to try to work on it when you’re married, but sometimes folks want out and so they don’t want to talk it out. It does happen. He also may be making a statement by leaving because he feels like you need wake up call. He could feel taken for granted or unappreciated.\n",
      "I imagine you want to stay married? Calmly tell him that you heard what he said about the negativity and the communication and you’re willing to address it. You want to go to therapy with him to work on resolving his concerns. Extend the olive branch. See what he says.\n",

You really have to be committed, with every relationship whether it be long distance or not, communication is KEY, but even more so with ldr.

(And while I dont exactly have stats for this, I'm sure a bit of research and digging could provide that, but here are a few points off of the top of my head):\n",
      "• Pros\n",
      "- Law enforcement would see a significant drop in imprisonment rates.\n",
      "- Less criminal charges means less expenditures for incarceration. (And the money saved from that could be used virtually anywhere to benefit society).\n",
      "- Those imprisoned for drug-related (non-violent) crimes would be issued pardons or released, thus aiding the current overcrowding prisons crisis.\n",
      "- Eventually, the use of drugs would eliminate a taboo and would become a societal norm, thus creating less appeal/\"excitement\" for those who wish to recklessly experiment with them --> (With addiction being viewed and accepted as an illness rather than a crime, substance abuse would be avoided).\n",
      "- Experimentalists would provide an excellent data base for medical researchers!! lol although I'd say that's more of a downside (nobody likes being a guinea pig)\n",
      "• Cons\n",
      "- Allowing narcotics to be more accessable (price reduction) and mainstreaming them still d o e s encourage experimentation. --> More cases would be found in chronic addiction.\n",
      "- It would place a heavy burden on rehabilitation programs (to provide more resources, treatments, etc.)\n",
      "- Drugs are dangerous! They create a multiplicity of issues to people's health, mentally, physically, etc. and would result in an influx of demand for the medical field, specifically.\n",
      "- Legalization would also create a challenge for regulation and for conceptualizing arrest criterion in such a situation such as getting pulled over for speeding due to heavy drug intake.\n",
      "- Not to mention what rules would have to be formalized and carried out for drug users in the workplace (similar to the current rules regarding alcohol and smoking).\n",
      "- Violence/crime rates would be through the roof and public safety would be jeapordized what with drugs' intoxicating effect on individuals, impairing their judgements and subjecting them to rash actions in social environments.\n",
      "- That ^ could be a gateway to adding pressure to the aforementioned overcrowding prisons crisis, resulting in even more demand for government spending.\n",
      "+ This could come off as judgemental, but idc: if drugs are no longer regulated, and become intertwined with people's normal lives, it would be enough to make anybody uneasy at the thought of these people voting, holding places of power in government, etc. Ultimately, would shake the credibility of a system built on democracy.\n",
      "~ Because the vast majority of people are already irresponsible and ill-informed, there is no substantial reason in gearing them with the use of lethal drugs at their will. Essentially, I see that legalizing all drugs could result in a snowball effect and deteriorate society in a snap.\n",

Один шаг с его же стороны и он счастлив. Знаю, что многие не решаются, но очень зря. Да и вообще, если реально девушка нравится-то нужно делать шаги, пока не поздно.

Я не бегаю за людьми, которым на меня всё равно, не вешаюсь на парней и сижу дома.Я часто читаю, за это многие думают, что я скучная. Ну и я 100% уверена, что лучше многих в том, что не перевстречалась с половиной парней моего города и жду своего единственного. Могу сказать, что я воспитана.

Отношения-это то, что нужно строить, создавать, а не просто \" абы парень был\". Так что, прежде чем задавать постоянно подобные вопросы, хоть немного думайте.\n",

Lục lọi mãi mới thấy một mẩu bút chì đã cùn, lại chẳng tìm được gọt, tôi liền lấy con dao gần đó để gọt. Chệch tay một cái, lưỡi dao đã quệt một nhát sâu vào ngón tay. Nhưng tôi không khóc, bèn chạy xuống tìm bà, máu ở tay cứ thể nhỏ xuống nền theo đường tôi đi. Bà đang lim dim trên chiếc sofa, gọi mãi bà mới dậy, ấp úng kể lại sự tình hồi lâu thì máu đã chảy đầy dưới chân. Dường như mới thoát ra khỏi cơn mơ màng, bà kéo tôi ra sân sau, lấy vài cái lá cho vào miệng nhai rồi đắp lên tay tôi, vừa làm vừa mắng cho đến lúc dọn xong từng vết máu dưới sàn.\n",
      "Bà tôi là một phụ nữ tài giỏi, cam chịu và suốt đời lam lũ. Tôi may mắn được sống cùng bà, đặc biệt là trong một gia đình đa thế hệ. Từ nhỏ tôi đã được tiếp xúc và lắng nghe ý kiến và quan điểm của mọi người, do vậy không bị chịu ảnh hưởng từ quan điểm một chiều của bố mẹ. Tôi luôn nhìn nhận mọi thứ theo nhiều khía cạnh và khách quan nhất. Và điều này đã tránh cho tôi bị ảnh hưởng bởi những nhận thức sai lệch khi còn nhỏ.\n",

Từ đó tôi thích mê được đi xe đạp, liền bắt ông tháo hai bánh của chiếc xe bốn bánh hoen gỉ đã vứt xó ở góc sân để tôi tập đi. Ông tôi không chịu, chỉ tháo một bên. Không nói lại được, tôi ấm ức phát khóc. Về sau cuối cùng cũng được thỏa tâm nguyện, tôi đem xe ra đường tự tập. Cứ ngồi lên xe là ra sức đạp, như vậy xe sẽ không bị nghiêng đổ, khi nào thấy xe sắp đổ là tôi liền nhảy ra, vứt xe ở đấy. Nhiều lần như vậy, chiếc xe vốn đã cũ kĩ càng trở nên tàn tạ... Nhưng kết quả là tôi thành thạo đi được xe đạp từ rất sớm. Mẹ tôi từ đó hay tự hào kể chuyện tôi đã tự tập đi xe đạp như thế nào với mọi người. Mỗi lần như vậy tôi lại nhận được vô số lời tấm tắc khen ngợi...\n",

Vậy nên mấy ngàn mấy trăm năm không có kẻ nào đến gần và dám chạm vào xương rồng cả.\n",

Đi qua hiệu mình thấy lờ mờ qua cửa kính bóng quen thuộc của anh họ, sau khi chắc chắn mình mới đẩy cửa bước vào trước sự ngỡ ngàng của \"anh hàng xóm\". Anh mất vài giây mới mở miệng hỏi, chắc nghĩ rằng mình vào mua thuốc lá...\n",
      "Lần này mình mới chính thức nhìn kĩ dung mạo anh ấy: lông mi dài, dày tuy không cong lắm; mặt khá ưa nhìn tuy hơn lùn, chắc gần 1m7 là cùng. Mình đặc biệt ấn tượng với giọng hát anh ấy, hay lắm luôn, khác xa giọng mình hay nghe, tưởng như chẳng phải một người. Giọng êm, gọn và ấm. Anh ấy còn biết chơi guitar, đang dạy cho anh họ mình. Thỉnh thoảng mình có hứng lên hát vài câu đệm tiếng đàn, anh ấy khen mình hát tốt, có năng khiếu nhưng còn bản năng và ề à lắm. Mình hào hứng lắm, nhưng không để lộ cảm xúc. Lần đầu tiên có người nhận xét mình chuyên môn như vậy. Các bạn mình lúc nghe hát chỉ nhận xét là hay hay không hay thôi chứ chẳng ai nói tốt ở đâu, chưa tốt chỗ nào.\n",
      "Anh còn kể về hồi còn học cấp 3, toàn chơi với đầu gấu, bạn anh đánh nhau thậm chí còn chém nhau là chuyện thường. Rồi chuyện đối phó với thầy cô. Nghe khá hấp dẫn. Mà mình hứng thú nhất là chuyện phân biệt cần và cỏ. Cần thì có thể hút, thậm chí là tốt cho sức khỏe, giúp giảm stress và ăn ngon hơn. Còn cỏ thì tuyệt đối không được đụng đến. Một khi đã hút cỏ, nhìn thấy xe chạy ngoài đường chỉ muốn lao vào thôi. Cần thì nhìn giống thuốc lá, các sợi được bọc trong lá giống thuốc thường. Còn cỏ thì là loại bột. Có nhiều học sinh cấp 3 đến mua rất nhiều giấy thuốc lá để bọc cỏ, lừa bạn mình hút.\n",
